# Chris Holder Dot Dev

This is the code for my personal website at [chrisholder.dev](https://chrisholder.dev).

I've been inspired by [Plain Vanilla](https://plainvanillaweb.com/) and building everything for this site by hand, using web standards. I use frameworks, build tools, and services in my day-to-day work. **I love them!** They solve many problems and overall make me more productive. But this site is not about being productive, and I spend a lot of time debugging build steps, dependency rot, and a whole host of other things introduced by the complexity brought on by adopting these abstractions.

This site is an escape from that world. This is project I can keep up to speed on what the web platform offers natively and learn to appreciate what frameworks, build tools, and services offer me as out-of-the-box solutions.

üçª So here's to a simple, native site!

Thanks for stopping by!
