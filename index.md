I'm Chris Holder and this is my little slice of the internet. Thanks for stopping by.

I’m a software engineer with over 6 years of experience working primarily on the web. I’m experienced building full-stack applications with a focus on the front-end.

Most recently, I’ve worked on the [**WordPress.com Reader**](https://wordpress.com/discover) and [**Jetpack Newsletter**](https://jetpack.com/newsletter/) at [**Automattic**](https://automattic.com/), using React, TypeScript, SCSS, and PHP.

I’ve also built design systems and component libraries using React, Vue, Ruby, and Java for [**Ramsey Solutions**](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/), empowering hundreds of engineers to build beautiful, consistent user interfaces quickly.

I’m a husband to my beautiful wife of 10 years and a dad to two amazing kids. I love running, weightlifting, backpacking, and playing video games.

If you’d like to connect about work, you can [**send me an email**](mailto:chris@chrisholder.dev) or reach out on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrispholder). To see what I’ve been working on, take a peek at my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/holdercp/)
