    <main><h1>Uses</h1>
<p>This is a list of hardware, software, and products I use to get things done as a software engineer. It’s inspired by <a href="https://uses.tech">uses.tech</a>. I’ll keep this page updated as things change, and hopefully you might find something useful to add to your own setup.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>
<ul>
<li>For my computer I’m currently using a <strong>2023, M3 Max, 16-inch, Apple MacBook Pro with 32 GB of RAM</strong>. Not much to say here. Apple makes great hardware and Mac OS is great for development.</li>
<li>I use the <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/apple-studio-display">Apple Studio Display</a></strong> as my monitor. The resolution and color is amazing and the built-in webcam and speakers were a selling point for me.</li>
<li>I’m using an <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXCK3LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-usb-c-us-english">Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID</a></strong> for my keyboard. I prefer a mechanical keyboard but I like the Touch ID integration.</li>
<li>I use the <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK93AM/A/magic-trackpad-usb%E2%80%91c-white-multi-touch-surface">Apple Magic Trackpad</a></strong> instead of a mouse. I like using gestures and not having to switch muscle memory when I’m using the laptop away from my desk. I try to use the keyboard as much as possible, so I only really miss a mouse when doing precision work when editing images.</li>
<li>For my desk, I use the <strong><a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/autonomous-desk-eureka">Autonomous SmartDesk 2</a></strong>. It’s quiet, sturdy, and has a great range of height adjustment. I like that it has programmable presets for sitting and standing.</li>
<li>I use the <strong><a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair">Autonomous ErgoChair Pro</a></strong> for my chair. It has plenty of adjustment points and is quite comfy.</li>
<li>The <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro">Airpods Pro 2</a></strong> are my go-to headphones. I mainly use headphones when I need to take a call to cut down on ambient noise. Noise cancelling, the built-in mic, and the Apple integration make them great for me.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software</h2>
<ul>
<li>I use a minimally configured <strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a></strong> as my code editor. It’s fast, has great extensions, and is easy to customize. I’ve given <a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a> several tries and I really like it. It’s just missing some features I really like in VSCode, like an integrated debugger.</li>
<li>I like <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> using Claude 3.7 Sonnet (this will be out of date really fast) for an AI assistant. I’ve tried Cursor in the past but Copilot’s Agent Mode has been great as a pair programmer.</li>
<li>I use <strong>Terminal.app</strong> built in to Mac OS for my terminal. I’ve used other terminals before, like iTerm2 and Warp, but I found I hardly used any of their features. I really like the philosophy of <a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> though so I may give it a shot if I run into frustrations with Terminal.app.</li>
<li>I use <strong><a href="https://google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a></strong> as my primary browser. As a web developer, I test things across multiple browsers but Chrome has great developer tools and great extensions. I really wished Arc would not have pivoted</li>
