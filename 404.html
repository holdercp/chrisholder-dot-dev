  Unfortunately, this page doesn't exist. You can get back home following

<p>
  Or you can stick around and read one of my favorite exchanges from
  <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em> between Frodo and Sam...
</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/characters/nm0000276">
  <p><strong>Frodo:</strong> I can't do this, Sam.</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Sam:</strong> I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be
    here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that
    really mattered. Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you
    didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could
    the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in
    the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A
    new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
    Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if
    you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do
    understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning
    back, only they didn't. They kept going. Because they were holding on to
    something.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Frodo:</strong> What are we holding onto, Sam?</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Sam:</strong> That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo... and
    it's worth fighting for.
