          This is a list of hardware, software, and products I use to get things
          done as a software engineer. It's inspired by
          <a href="https://uses.tech/">uses.tech</a>. I'll keep this page
          updated as things change, and hopefully you might something useful to
          add to your own setup.

              For my computer I'm currently using a

                RAM</strong
              >. Not much to say here. Apple makes great hardware and Mac OS is
              great for development.
            </li>
            <li>
              I use the

                ></strong
              >
              as my monitor. The resolution and color is amazing and the
              built-in webcam and speakers where a selling point for me.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm using an

              for my keyboard. I prefer a mechanical keyboard but I like the
              Touch ID integration.

            <li>
              I use the

              instead of a mouse. I like using gestures and not having to switch
              muscle memory when I'm using the laptop away from my desk. I try
              to use the keyboard as much as possible, so I only really miss a
              mouse when doing precision work when editing images.

              For my desk, I use the

                  >Autonomous SmartDesk 2</a
                ></strong
              >. It's quiet, sturdy, and has a great range of height adjustment.
              I like that it has programmable presets for sitting and standing.

              for my chair. It has plenty of adjustment points and is quite
              comfy.

              are my go-to headphones. I mainly use headphones when I need to
              take a call to cut down on ambient noise. Noise cancelling, the
              built-in mic, and the Apple integration make them great for me.

              I use a minimally configured

              as my code editor. It's fast, has great extensions, and is easy to
              customize. I've given <a href="https://zed.dev/">Zed</a> several
              tries and I really like it. It's just missing some features I
              really like in VSCode, like an integrated debugger.
            </li>
            <li>
              I like <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> using Claude 3.7 Sonnet
              (this will be out of date really fast) for an AI assistant. I've
              tried Cursor in the past but Copilot's Agent Mode has been great
              as a pair programmer.
            </li>
            <li>
              I use <strong>Terminal.app</strong> built in to Mac OS for my
              terminal. I've used other terminals before, like iTerm2 and Warp,
              but I found I hardly used any of their features. I really like the
              philosphy of <a href="https://ghostty.org/">Ghostty</a> though so
              I may give it a shot if I run into frustrations with Terminal.app.

              as my primary browser. As a web developer, I test things across
              multiple browsers but Chrome has great developer tools and great
              extensions. I really wished Arc would not have pivoted to
