This is a list of hardware, software, and products I use to get things done as a software engineer. It’s inspired by [uses.tech](https://uses.tech). I’ll keep this page updated as things change, and hopefully you might find something useful to add to your own setup.

## Hardware

- For my computer I’m currently using a **2023, M3 Max, 16-inch, Apple MacBook Pro with 32 GB of RAM**. Not much to say here. Apple makes great hardware and Mac OS is great for development.
- I use the **[Apple Studio Display](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/apple-studio-display)** as my monitor. The resolution and color is amazing and the built-in webcam and speakers were a selling point for me.
- I’m using an **[Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXCK3LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-usb-c-us-english)** for my keyboard. I prefer a mechanical keyboard but I like the Touch ID integration.
- I use the **[Apple Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK93AM/A/magic-trackpad-usb%E2%80%91c-white-multi-touch-surface)** instead of a mouse. I like using gestures and not having to switch muscle memory when I’m using the laptop away from my desk. I try to use the keyboard as much as possible, so I only really miss a mouse when doing precision work when editing images.
- For my desk, I use the **[Autonomous SmartDesk 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/autonomous-desk-eureka)**. It’s quiet, sturdy, and has a great range of height adjustment. I like that it has programmable presets for sitting and standing.
- I use the **[Autonomous ErgoChair Pro](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair)** for my chair. It has plenty of adjustment points and is quite comfy.
- The **[Airpods Pro 2](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro)** are my go-to headphones. I mainly use headphones when I need to take a call to cut down on ambient noise. Noise cancelling, the built-in mic, and the Apple integration make them great for me.

## Software

- I use a minimally configured **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** as my code editor. It’s fast, has great extensions, and is easy to customize. I’ve given [Zed](https://zed.dev/) several tries and I really like it. It’s just missing some features I really like in VSCode, like an integrated debugger.
- I like **GitHub Copilot** using Claude 3.7 Sonnet (this will be out of date really fast) for an AI assistant. I’ve tried Cursor in the past but Copilot’s Agent Mode has been great as a pair programmer.
- I use **Terminal.app** built in to Mac OS for my terminal. I’ve used other terminals before, like iTerm2 and Warp, but I found I hardly used any of their features. I really like the philosophy of [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) though so I may give it a shot if I run into frustrations with Terminal.app.
- I use **[Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome)** as my primary browser. As a web developer, I test things across multiple browsers but Chrome has great developer tools and great extensions. I really wished Arc would not have pivoted
