      <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Chris Holder.</h1>

      <p>This is my little slice of the internet. Thanks for stopping by.</p>

      <p>
          Iâ€™m a software engineer working from Nashville, TN, and Iâ€™m currently looking for my next opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a husband to my beautiful wife of 9 years and a dad to two amazing
        kids. I love working on software that solves people's problems, helps
        them learn something new, or adds a little fun to their lives.
