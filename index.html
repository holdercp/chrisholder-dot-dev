      <h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Chris Holder.</h1>

      <p>This is my little slice of the internet. Thanks for stopping by.</p>

      <p>
        I'm a software engineer working at Ramsey Solutions in Nashville, TN.
        I'm currently working on building the Ramsey Design System, which
        unifies the Ramsey brand across all of our digital products and makes
        collaboration between designers and engineers more efficient and
        productive.
      </p>

        I'm a husband to my beautiful wife of 9 years and a dad to two amazing
        kids. I love working on software that solves people's problems, helping
        them learn something new, or adds a little fun to their lives.
